# 🧠 Pi-HPC-Lab

> **High-Performance Computing on Raspberry Pi Cluster**  
> A lightweight distributed computing lab for mathematics, physics, and AI simulation — built entirely on Raspberry Pi devices.

## 🌍 Overview

**Pi-HPC-Lab** is a collection of distributed computation experiments designed for small ARM clusters  
(such as Raspberry Pi 5 or Jetson Orin Nano).  
It demonstrates how fundamental mathematical, physical, and optimization problems can be solved in **parallel** across multiple nodes — using pure Python and lightweight frameworks (e.g., sockets, Dask, NumPy).

This project aims to:
- Build a **mini supercomputer** environment with low-cost hardware.  
- Study **parallel algorithms** for mathematical & physical simulations.  
- Provide reusable code templates for distributed computing education and experimentation.
